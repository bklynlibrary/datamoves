i think we need a lot of new buildings such as libraries , schools , hotels , shelters , and new houses and apartmemts. i pick this because we need more to keep the people from being outside on the streets , and we need these building because nowadays their are alot of cold homeless people outside on the streets. Would these building help the community?
