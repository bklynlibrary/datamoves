Each week of the internship, participants will be asked to post something to this blog: either a reflection, documentation of a project, or resources to share with the public. 

To access the blog, you'll need to be added to the [Siteleaf](https://www.siteleaf.com) CMS (short for Content Management System) by Maya. 

Once added, login with your email, and look for the section titled "Posts" (not "Pages," and not "Sections"). There you can add a New Post, or edit one of your old posts. 

Happy publishing!
