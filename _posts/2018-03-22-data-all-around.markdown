Today my tech team and I learned about very numerous Data's. We learned about Data opening ,Data discrimniation which explained to us the pros and cons about data . For example the topic about data discrimination bascically tells us that the less wealthy you are the less data you will recieve . They are also taking data from low markets and placing them in higher places. Another fact about what we learned today is that once you agree to something you have to read or you will be signing away your life.
