<h2>About the Internship</h2>

This cohort of the Tech Lab will learn about networks and how data travels, both from a technical perspective, and from a civic and political perspective. The 3-month session will be organized around three projects, and will give young people to opportunity to develop marketable skills in web development and wireless networks, to create media to teach an intergenerational audience about data and privacy issues, and to build their own internet/mesh wireless network along Belmont Avenue. Additionally, students will leave with the skills to be lifelong learners by using library resources, online resources, and cooperative learning networks.
