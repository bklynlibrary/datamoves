It can often feel like we have little control over our personal information, and by extension, our lives. Using the internet, or just existing in a connected world with sensors and monitoring technologies enables surveillance by law enforcement, parents, peers, and schools, can affect access to opportunities and resources, and can expose us in ways we never asked for. We want learners to build an understanding of how to personally control what information is transmitted, but also why and how governments, corporations, and nonprofit institutions use and control our data and communication tools, and how to make change in these systems (and how to build our own alternatives).
