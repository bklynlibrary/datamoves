# Data Moves Spring 2018 Internship Site

Welcome to the internship website for the spring BCJC tech lab: *How Data Moves*! We'll be learning web design principles by editing this site, and will post projects and resources for one another here.

## Editing Content

To add a blog post, or edit content on the site, get an invitation from [Maya](mailto:mawagoner@bklynlibrary.org) and then login through [Siteleaf](https://manage.siteleaf.com/login). From there, click on "Posts" in the sidebar and add a new post, or edit an old one. All changes are reflected in the [list of **commits**](https://github.com/mayawagon/datamoves/commits/master). 

## Editing Code

The code for the site is stored here in the repository. I recommend clicking around the files above to explore! If you want to improve, contribute to, or modify the site, look to the [**"Fork"**](https://help.github.com/articles/about-forks/) button in the top right. This will create a copy on your account that you can mess with as you please. When you're excited about the changes you've made and think the main site should include them for all, come back here and submit a [**Pull Request**](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/). Maya will then review your changes and decide whether to incorporate them. 

## Thanks

This site was adapted from the [Jekyll Prologue theme by Chris Bobbe](https://github.com/chrisbobbe/jekyll-theme-prologue), and that repository provides some information on things unique to the theme.
