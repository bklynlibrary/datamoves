# Data Moves Spring 2018 Internship Site

Welcome to the internship website for the spring BCJC tech lab: *How Data Moves*! We'll be learning web design principles by editing this site, and will post projects and resources for one another here. 

This site was adapted from the [Jekyll Prologue theme by Chris Bobbe](https://github.com/chrisbobbe/jekyll-theme-prologue). 

For more information on Jekyll, go to [https://jekyllrb.com](https://jekyllrb.com).
